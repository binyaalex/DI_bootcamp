// Exercise1
// Create a form like the one above. The form should contain three inputs:
// a small text input asking for a name,
// a larger textarea input to write a message,
// a submit input (“Send”)

// When you click the Send button, the form will be submitted with a GET method. (you can use the same HTML file for the action url)
// Where will the sent data appear? in the url as a query string

// Exercise2
// Use the same form structure as Exercise 1.
// When you click the Send button, the form will be submitted with a POST method.(you can use the same HTML file for the action url)
// Where will the sent data appear? Hint : Look at the Network Tab in the network
 //answer: in the html in the form data
